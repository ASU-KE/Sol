Sol Node Status
===============

Scrapes SLURM via `sinfo` and plots node status with `plotly`.

On Sol's `admin.sol.rc.asu.edu`, the user `software` runs the generating shell
and python scripts via `crontab`:

    * * * * * /packages/public/sol-node-status/get-sol-node-status.sh &> /packages/public/sol-node-status/crontab.diag

Current version is available from [rcstatus][rcstatus].

Shell script will only save every tenth `zstd -19` compressed comma-separated
value (csv) files (every ten minutes). This is determined by an incremented
counter that is stored in `snapshot/.snapshot_modulo.do.not.delete`. When there
are errors, the `zstd` file will not be generated and `csv`s will not be
removed. This is to help determine what occurred in the data and catch all edge
cases.

Debugging
---------

Diagnose issues from diagnostics file generated by cron:

    /packages/public/sol-node-status/crontab.diag

and from Python runtime:

    /packages/public/sol-node-status/crontab.diag.log

Note: `crontab.diag` is non-empty upon successful execution with normal
diagnostic statistics on the plotly figure, i.e., 

    len :: total number of nodes being visualized
      M :: number of nodes in figure's horizontal direction
      N :: number of nodes in figure's vertical direction
      w :: figure width in pixels
      h :: figure height in pixels

Planned
-------

* Implement via JS in kibana.
* Automate monthly archiving of snapshot data.
